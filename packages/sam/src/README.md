# @nx-aws/sam

[Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io) Builders for [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) projects,
designed for use alongside [nx](https://nx.dev)

## Why

nx superpowers the angular CLI, to add support for a range of backend project types.

However, what if your backend uses SAM?

This project includes builders for that!

-   @nx-aws/sam:build - builds your functions
-   @nx-aws/sam:package - packages your SAM (ie. CloudFormation) deployment
-   @nx-aws/sam:deploy - deploys your CloudFormation template

## How?

Instructions to follow! I'm working on this project with screaming toddler hanging off my leg,
so bear with me :-) If you've come across this and want to use it, please get in touch -
that will spur & guide some extra documentation.
